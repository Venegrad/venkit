## Smart information

To work with sources you need nodejs https://nodejs.org/uk/, download and install for your os. When installing, mark the item "Path ". 

1. At the root of the folder, run the command ```npm gulp -g && npm i```. If you get an error, then you have not installed nodejs.
2. To compile the sources, use the command ```npm run build```
